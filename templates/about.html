        <h1>About Our Pneumonia Detection App</h1>
        <p>This application leverages advanced AI and deep learning models to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The final objective is to integrate the trained model into a full-stack web 
application that allows users to upload chest X-ray images and receive 
predictions regarding the presence of pneumonia. The application will also 
include features such as real-time analysis, intuitive user interface, medical 
report generation, and history tracking. This makes the system practical and 
ready for deployment in real-world clinical environments or as a diagnostic aid 
for medical professionals. </p>
